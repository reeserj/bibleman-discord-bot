# Bible Reading Discord Bot Project

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to create a Discord bot that helps track Bible reading progress. The bot will:
- Send daily Bible reading messages at 5 AM CST
- Display nicely formatted verses and relevant links
- Allow users to react to messages to mark completion
- Track reading performance in Google Sheets
- Use an Excel sheet as the source for reading plans

**UPDATE**: The user has requested to remove all standalone desktop app features, keeping only the core Discord bot functionality.

**NEW REQUEST**: The user wants to install the Discord MCP server from https://github.com/v-3/discordmcp to enable Claude integration with Discord channels.

**MCP SERVER INSTALLATION COMPLETED** âœ…

**What's Been Installed:**
1. **Discord MCP Server Repository**: Cloned from https://github.com/v-3/discordmcp
2. **Dependencies**: All npm packages installed and vulnerabilities fixed
3. **Build**: TypeScript compiled successfully to JavaScript
4. **Configuration**: Environment variables configured with existing Discord token
5. **Testing**: Server tested and confirmed working (Discord bot connects successfully)

**Installation Location**: `/home/reese/.cursor/Bibleman/discordmcp/`

**Available Tools:**
- `send-message`: Send messages to Discord channels
- `read-messages`: Read recent messages from Discord channels

**How to Use with Claude Desktop:**
1. Open Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
2. Add the Discord MCP server configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/home/reese/.cursor/Bibleman/discordmcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DISCORD_TOKEN": "[YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE]"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
3. Restart Claude Desktop

**Current Status**: Discord MCP server is fully installed and ready for Claude integration.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Discord Bot Setup**: Need to create a Discord application and bot, handle authentication

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Channel Selection Feature Completed! âœ…**

**What's Been Implemented:**

1. **Text-Based Channel Selector:**
   - Created `channel-selector.js` with interactive CLI interface
   - Lists all accessible Discord channels with numerical selection
   - Shows current channel selection and allows changes
   - Validates channel permissions before saving

2. **Desktop App Integration:**
   - Added `select-channel.sh` script for easy channel selection
   - Updated `start-bot.sh` to include channel selection option
   - Added new command: `./start-bot.sh channel`
   - Integrated into existing bot management workflow

3. **Bot Channel Logic Updates:**
   - Enhanced `scheduler.js` with dynamic channel validation
   - Added channel change detection and caching
   - Improved error handling for channel access issues
   - Added channel information commands to bot

4. **Configuration Persistence:**
   - Channel selection automatically saves to `.env` file
   - Updates `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` and `DISCORD_GUILD_ID`
   - Adds timestamp for channel selection tracking

**How to Use:**
1. Run `./start-bot.sh channel` to select a channel
2. Or run `./select-channel.sh` directly
3. Follow the interactive prompts to select a channel
4. Restart the bot to use the new channel selection

**Current Status:**
- Channel selection feature is fully implemented
- Ready for testing with actual Discord server
- Bot will validate channel access before sending messages
- All channel changes are persisted to configuration

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the channel selection with a real Discord server
2. Verify that bot messages are sent to the selected channel
3. Test channel validation and error handling

**What's Been Fixed:**

1. **User Tagging Issue Fixed:**
   - Updated leaderboard to properly display usernames instead of just user IDs
   - Added proper Discord mention formatting (`<@userId>`)
   - Now shows both username and mention for better user experience

2. **Days Behind Calculation Fixed:**
   - Replaced hardcoded 7-day assumption with real reading plan data
   - Added `getTotalReadingDays()` method to calculate actual total days from the reading plan sheet
   - Added `getCurrentReadingDay()` method to determine current day based on actual dates
   - Days behind now calculated as: `currentDay - completedDays` instead of `totalDays - completedDays`

3. **Days Running Calculation Added:**
   - Leaderboard now shows "Day X of Y total days" in the summary
   - Calculates current day based on today's date vs reading plan dates
   - Uses the "Day" column from the reading plan sheet for accurate day numbering

4. **Real Data Integration:**
   - Updated `getWeeklyProgress()` to use real data from SheetsTracker instead of fallback data
   - Leaderboard now pulls actual user completion data from Google Sheets
   - Proper error handling with fallback data only when real data fails

**Technical Implementation:**
- Added new methods in `sheetsTracker.js`: `getTotalReadingDays()` and `getCurrentReadingDay()`
- Updated `getLeaderboard()` to use real calculations instead of hardcoded values
- Enhanced `formatWeeklyLeaderboard()` in `scheduler.js` with better user display and days running info
- Improved error handling and logging throughout

**Current Status:**
- Bot is running with updated leaderboard functionality
- Ready to test the improved leaderboard with real data
- All calculations now based on actual reading plan data from Google Sheets

**Next Steps:**
1. Test the leaderboard by using the `/leaderboard` command in Discord
2. Verify that user mentions work properly
3. Confirm that days behind calculation is accurate
4. Check that days running information is correct

**Ready for Testing**: The leaderboard should now properly tag users and show accurate progress calculations based on the actual reading plan data.
