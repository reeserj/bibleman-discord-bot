# Bible Reading Discord Bot Project

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to create a Discord bot that helps track Bible reading progress. The bot will:
- Send daily Bible reading messages at 5 AM CST
- Display nicely formatted verses and relevant links
- Allow users to react to messages to mark completion
- Track reading performance in Google Sheets
- Use an Excel sheet as the source for reading plans

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Discord Bot Setup**: Need to create a Discord application and bot, handle authentication
2. **Scheduling**: Implement daily message sending at 5 AM CST using cron jobs or similar
4. **Google Sheets Integration**:Parse Excel files to extract daily reading plans,  Track user reactions and reading progress
5. **Message Formatting**: Create attractive, readable Discord messages with embeds
6. **Reaction Tracking**: Monitor user reactions and store data appropriately
7. **Error Handling**: Handle various edge cases and failures gracefully

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Discord Bot Foundation (Priority: HIGH)
**Goal**: Create a working Discord bot with basic functionality

#### 1.1 Discord Application Setup
- [ ] Create Discord application at https://discord.com/developers/applications
- [ ] Add bot to application and get bot token
- [ ] Configure bot permissions (Send Messages, Read Message History, Add Reactions)
- [ ] Generate invite link with proper scopes and permissions
- [ ] Test bot connection to Discord server

#### 1.2 Core Bot Implementation
- [ ] Implement `src/scheduler.js` - Daily message scheduling logic
- [ ] Implement `src/messageFormatter.js` - Discord embed creation
- [ ] Implement `src/utils/helpers.js` - Utility functions
- [ ] Add environment variable validation
- [ ] Test basic bot startup and connection

**Success Criteria**: Bot connects to Discord, responds to basic commands, logs properly

### Phase 2: Google Sheets Integration (Priority: HIGH)
**Goal**: Connect to Google Sheets for reading plans and progress tracking

#### 2.1 Google Cloud Setup
- [ ] Create Google Cloud Project
- [ ] Enable Google Sheets API
- [ ] Create service account and download credentials
- [ ] Set up Google Sheets for reading plans (template structure)
- [ ] Set up Google Sheets for progress tracking

#### 2.2 Sheets Integration Implementation
- [ ] Implement `src/sheetsParser.js` - Read daily reading plans from "2026 Plan" sheet
- [ ] Implement `src/sheetsTracker.js` - Track user progress in sheets
- [ ] Create data models for reading plans (Date, Message, Due, Reading, Day, Bonus Text, Start of Book, 10 min Bible, Bible Project, Bonus)
- [ ] Parse progress percentage from message column (e.g., "Day 1: 0.3% complete")
- [ ] Extract and format resource links (Bible Project videos, 10 Minute Bible Hour)
- [ ] Add error handling for API rate limits and failures
- [ ] Test with actual sheet data

**Success Criteria**: Can read daily plans from Google Sheets, can write progress data

### Phase 3: Message Scheduling & Formatting (Priority: HIGH)
