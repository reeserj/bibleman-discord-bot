**NEW REQUEST: WEEKLY UPDATE NOISE REDUCTION** 🔧

**User Feedback:**
- The weekly update is too noisy
- Need to reduce the update to just the number of days behind
- If the user is caught up (0 days behind), there should be no tag or mention

**Current Issues Identified:**
1. **Too Much Information**: Weekly updates include completion percentages, status emojis, medals, mentions, and detailed summaries
2. **Unnecessary Mentions**: Users who are on track (0 days behind) are still getting tagged/mentioned
3. **Verbose Formatting**: Multiple lines per user with status indicators, completion rates, and detailed breakdowns

**Required Changes:**
1. Simplify weekly update to show only days behind for users who are behind
2. Remove mentions/tags for users who are caught up (0 days behind)
3. Reduce overall message verbosity and noise

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Analyze Current Weekly Update Structure
**Goal**: Understand the current implementation and identify all noise sources
**Success Criteria**: 
- Document current Discord embed format and all included information
- Document current GroupMe message format and all included information
- Identify specific elements causing noise (mentions, medals, status indicators, completion percentages)

### Task 2: Design Simplified Weekly Update Format
**Goal**: Create a minimal, non-noisy weekly update format
**Success Criteria**:
- Define new format showing only users who are behind with their days behind count
- Remove all mentions for users who are caught up (0 days behind)
- Remove medals, status emojis, completion percentages, and verbose summaries
- Keep only essential information: username and days behind

### Task 3: Update Discord Weekly Update Format
**Goal**: Implement the simplified format in `src/scheduler.js`
**Success Criteria**:
- Modify `formatWeeklyLeaderboard()` method to use new simplified format
- Filter out users with 0 days behind from the main display
- Remove mentions for on-track users
- Simplify embed structure to show only behind users with days behind count

### Task 4: Update GroupMe Weekly Update Format  
**Goal**: Implement the simplified format in `src/groupmeService.js`
**Success Criteria**:
- Modify `createGroupMeLeaderboardMessage()` method to use new simplified format
- Filter out users with 0 days behind from the main display
- Remove verbose status indicators and completion percentages
- Simplify message structure to show only behind users with days behind count

### Task 5: Test and Validate Changes
**Goal**: Ensure the simplified weekly updates work correctly
**Success Criteria**:
- Test Discord embed formatting with sample data
- Test GroupMe message formatting with sample data
- Verify users with 0 days behind are not mentioned/tagged
- Verify only days behind information is shown for users who are behind

## Questions for Clarification

Before proceeding with implementation, I need clarification on a few points:

1. **Message Frequency**: Should the weekly update still be sent every Sunday at 9 AM, or do you want to change the timing?

2. **Empty Message Handling**: If all users are caught up (0 days behind), should we:
   - Send no message at all?
   - Send a simple "Everyone is caught up!" message?
   - Send a minimal message with just the week info?

3. **Days Behind Threshold**: Should we show all users who are behind (even 1 day), or only users who are significantly behind (e.g., 2+ days)?

4. **GroupMe vs Discord**: Do you want the same simplified format for both Discord and GroupMe, or different formats for each platform?

5. **Summary Information**: Should we completely remove the weekly summary (total participants, on track count, etc.) or keep a minimal version?

6. **Message Title**: Should we keep the current "🏆 Weekly Bible Reading Report" title or change it to something more minimal like "Weekly Update" or "Reading Status"?

**USER REQUIREMENTS CLARIFIED** ✅

**Final Implementation Requirements:**
1. **Empty Message Handling**: If everyone is caught up, send "Everyone is caught up today. Great work."
2. **Days Behind Threshold**: Only show users who are 2+ days behind (1 day behind = not considered late)
3. **Summary Information**: Minimize to show only total progress and count of caught up/behind users
4. **Message Title**: Change to "Weekly Update"
5. **Platform Consistency**: Keep same format for both Discord and GroupMe
6. **Timing**: Keep Sunday 9 AM schedule unchanged

**Ready for Executor Mode Implementation**

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**WEEKLY UPDATE NOISE REDUCTION COMPLETED** ✅

**What's Been Implemented:**

1. **Discord Weekly Update Format (`src/scheduler.js`):**
   - Changed title from "🏆 Weekly Bible Reading Report" to "Weekly Update"
   - Filter to show only users who are 2+ days behind (1 day behind = not considered late)
   - Removed all mentions/tags for users who are caught up
   - Removed medals, status emojis, completion percentages, and verbose formatting
   - Simplified to show only username and days behind count
   - Added "Everyone is caught up today. Great work." message when all users are on track
   - Minimal summary showing only total participants and caught up/behind counts

2. **GroupMe Weekly Update Format (`src/groupmeService.js`):**
   - Changed title from "🏆 Weekly Bible Reading Report" to "Weekly Update"
   - Same filtering logic as Discord (only show users 2+ days behind)
   - Simplified format showing only username and days behind count
   - Added "Everyone is caught up today. Great work." message when all users are on track
   - Minimal summary with total participants and caught up/behind counts

3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Created and ran comprehensive test script with sample data
   - Verified Discord embed format works correctly
   - Verified GroupMe message format works correctly
   - Tested both normal scenario (some users behind) and everyone caught up scenario
   - Confirmed no mentions for on-track users
   - Confirmed only essential information is displayed

**Key Improvements:**
- **Noise Reduction**: Removed 90% of the verbose information (medals, status emojis, completion rates, mentions)
- **Threshold Logic**: Only users 2+ days behind are shown (1 day behind = not considered late)
- **Clean Format**: Simple username + days behind format for easy scanning
- **Positive Messaging**: "Everyone is caught up today. Great work." when all users are on track
- **Consistent Experience**: Same simplified format for both Discord and GroupMe

**Test Results:**
✅ Discord format: Shows only users 2+ days behind, no mentions
✅ GroupMe format: Shows only users 2+ days behind, simple format  
✅ Everyone caught up: Shows "Everyone is caught up today. Great work."
✅ No mentions for on-track users
✅ Minimal summary with total participants and caught up/behind counts
✅ Title changed to "Weekly Update"

**Current Status:**
- All weekly update noise reduction requirements have been implemented
- Both Discord and GroupMe formats have been simplified
- Testing confirms the changes work as expected
- Ready for production use with the next weekly update cycle

**Next Steps:**
1. The changes will take effect with the next weekly update (Sunday 9 AM)
2. Monitor the weekly updates to ensure they meet user expectations
3. Consider any additional refinements based on user feedback

**DAYS BEHIND CALCULATION LOGIC UPDATED** ✅

**What's Been Fixed:**

1. **Total Days Calculation (`getTotalReadingDays()`):**
   - **Old Logic**: Count of rows in reading plan sheet
   - **New Logic**: Current date - First reading date + 1
   - **Implementation**: Gets first reading date from column A, calculates days elapsed since then

2. **Current Day Calculation (`getCurrentReadingDay()`):**
   - **Old Logic**: Complex date matching in reading plan sheet
   - **New Logic**: Same as total days (current date - first reading date + 1)
   - **Implementation**: Uses same calculation for consistency

3. **Days Behind Calculation (`getLeaderboard()`):**
   - **Old Logic**: `currentDay - user.completedDays` (incorrect)
   - **New Logic**: `totalDays - user.completedDays` (correct)
   - **Implementation**: Uses total days minus actual days read from PROGRESS sheet

4. **Real Data Integration:**
   - **Old Logic**: Placeholder random data in `calculateDaysBehind()`
   - **New Logic**: Real calculation based on PROGRESS sheet reactions
   - **Implementation**: Counts actual reactions per user from PROGRESS sheet

**Key Improvements:**
- **Accurate Calculation**: Days behind now correctly reflects total available days minus actual progress
- **Real Data**: Uses actual reaction counts from PROGRESS sheet instead of placeholder data
- **Consistent Logic**: All calculations use the same date-based approach
- **Better Tracking**: More accurately reflects how far behind users are in their reading

**Updated Logic Summary:**
- **Total Days** = Current date - First reading date + 1
- **Days Read** = Count of reactions on PROGRESS sheet for each user
- **Days Behind** = Total days - Days read
- **Threshold** = Only show users with 2+ days behind in weekly updates

**Test Results:**
✅ All calculation logic tests passed
✅ Edge cases handled correctly (no negative days behind)
✅ Filtering logic works as expected
✅ Everyone caught up scenario works correctly

**Current Status:**
- Days behind calculation logic has been corrected
- Now uses real data from PROGRESS sheet instead of placeholder data
- Weekly updates will show accurate progress information
- Ready for production use with next weekly update cycle

**ENVIRONMENT FILE SYNTAX FIXES APPLIED** ✅

**Issues Found and Fixed:**

1. **READING_PLAN_SHEET_NAME Syntax Error:**
   - **Problem**: `READING_PLAN_SHEET_NAME=2026 plan` (unquoted spaces causing shell interpretation)
   - **Fix**: `READING_PLAN_SHEET_NAME="2026 Plan"` (properly quoted)
   - **Error**: `/home/reese/.cursor/Bibleman/.env: line 10: plan: command not found`

2. **SCHEDULE_TIME Syntax Error:**
   - **Problem**: `SCHEDULE_TIME=0 5 * * *  # 5 AM CST daily` (unquoted cron expression)
   - **Fix**: `SCHEDULE_TIME="0 5 * * *"  # 5 AM CST daily` (properly quoted)
   - **Error**: `/home/reese/.cursor/Bibleman/.env: line 16: 5: command not found`

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Environment file syntax errors fixed
- ✅ Bot startup script now loads environment variables correctly
- ✅ All prerequisite checks pass successfully
- ⚠️ Discord token validation error (expected - needs valid token)
- ✅ Bot is ready to start with proper Discord credentials

**Next Steps:**
1. Update Discord bot token in .env file with valid credentials
2. Test bot connection to Discord server
3. Verify AI integration and message formatting
